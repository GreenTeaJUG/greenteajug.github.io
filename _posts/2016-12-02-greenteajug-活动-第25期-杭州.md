主题：JDK 9: Big Changes to Make Java Smaller
摘要：
JDK 9 is scheduled for general availability in July 2017.  The biggest new feature for this release of Java is Project Jigsaw that brings modularity to both the core JDK libraries as well as, potentially, application code.

Modularizing the JDK core libraries is not just a simple matter of breaking up the rt.jar file into a number of sections.  The Jigsaw module system allows for encapsulation of packages that developers do not want publicly exposed. Encapsulation of JDK internal APIs will potentially break backwards compatibility for application code that uses these APIs.  This session will explain the practicalities of running applications on JDK 9.

We'll also look at how you can migrate existing applications to the new module system in a gradual and controlled way to minimize impact on users.

讲师：Simon Ritter, Azul System 布道师，2014年曾作为Oracle布道师在中国巡回演讲，宣讲Java8。

Simon has been in the IT business since 1984 and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Brunel University in the U.K. Originally working in the area of UNIX development for AT&T UNIX System Labs and then Novell, Simon moved to Sun in 1996. At this time he started working with Java technology and has spent time working both in Java development and consultancy. Having moved to Oracle as part of the Sun acquisition he now focuses on the core Java platform, Java for client applications and embedded Java. He also continues to develop demonstrations that push the boundaries of Java for applications like gestural interfaces, embedded robot controllers and in-car systems.Follow him on Twitter, @speakjava.
